# Stock Analysis With Excel VBA


## Overview of Project 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. This process was originally completed in a similar format, however, the goal for this round was to increase the efficiency of the original code.

### Results
Before refactoring the code, I began by copying the code that was needed to create the input box, chart headers, ticker array, and to activate the appropriate worksheet. The steps were then listed out in order to set the structure for the refactoring. Below is the instruction and code as written in the file.

   '1a) Create a ticker Index
    tickerIndex = 0

    '1b) Create three output arrays
    Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long
    Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
    Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single
        
    ''2a) Create a for loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero.
    For i = 0 To 11
    tickerVolumes(i) = 0
    tickerStartingPrices(i) = 0
    tickerEndingPrices(i) = 0
    Next i
        
    ''2b) Loop over all the rows in the spreadsheet.
    For i = 2 To RowCount
    
        '3a) Increase volume for current ticker
        tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
        
        '3b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
        
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
        End If
            
        
        '3c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
         'If the next rowâ€™s ticker doesnâ€™t match, increase the tickerIndex.
        
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
        End If
            
            '3d Increase the tickerIndex.
            If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
                tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
            End If
      
    Next i
    
    '4) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.
    For i = 0 To 11
        
        Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
        Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = tickers(i)
        Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = tickerVolumes(i)
        Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = tickerEndingPrices(i) / tickerStartingPrices(i) - 1
        
    Next i

### Summary

The biggest benefit that occurred as a result of the refactoring was an decrease in macro run time. The original analysis took approximately one second to run, whereas our new analysis only took about a four of the time (approximately 0.25 seconds) to run. Attached below are the screenshots that indicate the run time for our new analysis.
